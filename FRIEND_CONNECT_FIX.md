# 🔧 Friend Connect Fix - Jitsi Meet Integration

## ❌ Problem

**Issue:** Random Google Meet links (like `meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`) don't work without proper Google API authentication.

**Error:** "The meeting code you entered doesn't work"

**Why:** Google requires API credentials to create valid Meet rooms. You can't just generate random codes.

---

## ✅ Solution

**Switched to Jitsi Meet** - An open-source video conferencing platform that:
- ✅ Works immediately (no API keys needed)
- ✅ Creates real, working video rooms
- ✅ Fully encrypted and secure
- ✅ 100% FREE forever
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Same quality as Google Meet

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Generated random IDs that didn't work
const meetId = 'abc-defg-hij'
return `https://meet.google.com/${meetId}` // ❌ Invalid!
```

### **After (Working):**
```javascript
// Generates unique Jitsi room IDs
const roomId = `ElderlyAssistant-${timestamp}-${random}`
return `https://meet.jit.si/${roomId}` // ✅ Works!
```

## 🎥 How It Works Now

### **User Flow:**

1. **User clicks** "Talk to a Friend"
2. **System matches** based on interests
3. **Jitsi room created** with unique ID
   - Example: `https://meet.jit.si/ElderlyAssistant-1234567890-abc123`
4. **Link sent to both users**
5. **Browser opens** Jitsi in new tab
6. **Both users** join the SAME room
7. **Video chat** starts immediately!

### **Unique Room ID Format:**
```
ElderlyAssistant-[timestamp]-[random]
         ↓            ↓          ↓
    Prefix      Ensures    Extra
              uniqueness  randomness
```
