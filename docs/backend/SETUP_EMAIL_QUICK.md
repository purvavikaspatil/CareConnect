**If "Invalid login" error:**
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is ON
- Generate a NEW app password
- Copy without spaces
- Use the app password, not your regular Gmail password

**If "Authentication failed":**
- Check EMAIL_USER has your correct Gmail address
- Check EMAIL_PASS has the 16-char app password
- No quotes around values in .env
- Restart the server after changing .env
