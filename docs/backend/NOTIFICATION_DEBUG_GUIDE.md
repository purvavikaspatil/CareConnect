# üîç Notification System Debugging Guide

This guide will help you identify and fix issues with your SOS notification system (Email and SMS).

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - Run the Diagnostic Tool

I've created an automated diagnostic tool that will check everything for you:

```bash
cd server
node debug-notifications.js
```

This will check:
1. ‚úÖ Environment variables configuration
2. ‚úÖ Email connection (Gmail)
3. ‚úÖ Twilio SMS connection
4. ‚úÖ Emergency contacts in database
5. ‚úÖ Send test notifications (optional)

---

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing `.env` File

**Symptom:** 
- Diagnostic shows all variables as "‚ùå Missing"
- No `.env` file in `server/` directory

**Solution:**
1. Create a new file named `.env` in the `server/` folder
2. Add the following content:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/elderly-assistant

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this

# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-char-app-password

# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE=+15551234567

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Issue 2: Gmail Email Not Working

**Symptom:**
- "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"
- Emails not being sent

**Solution:**

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Click on "2-Step Verification"
3. Follow the steps to enable it

#### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Select "Other (Custom name)" as device
4. Name it "Elderly Assistant"
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the 16-character password (ignore spaces)

#### Step 3: Update .env
```env
EMAIL_USER=youractual@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop  # Your 16-char password WITHOUT spaces
```

#### Step 4: Test
```bash
node debug-notifications.js
```

**Alternative Email Providers:**

If Gmail doesn't work, you can use other providers:

<details>
<summary>Outlook/Hotmail</summary>

```javascript
// In utils/sendEmail.js, change the transporter to:
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'hotmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Yahoo Mail</summary>

```javascript
// In utils/sendEmail.js, change the transporter to:
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'yahoo',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```
</details>

### Issue 3: Twilio SMS Not Working

**Symptom:**
- "Authentication failed" or "Invalid credentials"
- SMS not being sent

**Solution:**

#### Step 1: Create Twilio Account
1. Go to: https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Sign up (you get $15.50 free credit)
3. Verify your email and phone

#### Step 2: Get Account Credentials
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/
2. Find your **Account SID** (starts with "AC...")
3. Find your **Auth Token** (click "Show" to reveal)
4. Copy both

#### Step 3: Get a Phone Number
1. In Twilio Console, go to: **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy a number**
2. Select your country
3. Make sure it has **SMS** capability
4. Buy the number (free on trial)
5. Copy your number in format: `+15551234567`

#### Step 4: Verify Test Numbers (Trial Accounts Only)
If you're on a free trial, you must verify recipient numbers:

1. Go to: **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Verified Caller IDs**
2. Click "Add a new number"
3. Enter the phone number of your emergency contact
4. Verify it with the code sent via SMS

#### Step 5: Update .env
```env

TWILIO_AUTH=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
TWILIO_PHONE=+15551234567
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** 
- Phone numbers MUST be in E.164 format: `+[country code][number]`
- Example: `+15551234567` (US), `+447911123456` (UK), `+919876543210` (India)

### Issue 4: No Emergency Contacts

**Symptom:**
- "No contacts found" or "No contacts with email/phone"
- Diagnostic shows 0 contacts

**Solution:**

#### Add Contacts Through the App:
1. Start the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd elderly-assistant
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open: http://localhost:5173
3. Login or Sign up
4. Go to **Contacts** page
5. Add at least one contact with:
   - Name
   - Relation (optional)
   - **Email** (for email notifications)
   - **Phone** (for SMS notifications, must include country code like +1234567890)

#### Verify Contacts in Database:
```bash
node debug-notifications.js
```

The tool will show all contacts and their notification methods.

### Issue 5: Contacts Missing Email or Phone

**Symptom:**
- Contacts exist but "0 with email" or "0 with phone"

**Solution:**

1. Go to Contacts page in the app
2. Edit each contact

### Issue 6: Notifications Not Triggering During SOS

**Symptom:**
- SOS alert is created successfully
- But no emails or SMS received
- No errors shown

**Solution:**

#### Check Server Logs:
When you trigger an SOS alert, you should see logs like:

```
üö® SOS ALERT TRIGGERED
üì• Received from user: John Doe (john@example.com)
üìç Location data received: { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 }
‚úÖ Location will be saved
üíæ Alert saved to MongoDB with ID: 64abc123...
Email alerts sent: 2 successful, 0 failed
SMS alerts sent: 2 successful, 0 failed
‚úÖ SOS Alert created successfully
```

If you see errors in logs, they will tell you what's wrong.

#### Common Log Errors:

**"Twilio not configured. Skipping SMS."**
‚Üí Add Twilio credentials to .env

**"No contacts with email addresses found"**
‚Üí Add email addresses to your contacts

**"No contacts with phone numbers found"**

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Do I need both email AND SMS?</strong></summary>

No! You can use just one:
- Email only: Set up EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS
- SMS only: Set up TWILIO credentials
- Both: Set up both (recommended)

The system will use whatever is available.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can I use a free Twilio account?</strong></summary>

Yes! The free trial includes:
- $15.50 credit
- 1 free phone number
- Can send SMS to verified numbers only
- Must verify recipient numbers first

To send to ANY number without verification, upgrade to paid account.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Why aren't my contacts receiving notifications?</strong></summary>

Check:
1. Contacts have valid email/phone in database
2. Email/SMS credentials are correct in .env
3. Server is running and showing logs
4. Gmail app password is generated (not regular password)
5. Twilio recipient numbers are verified (free trial)
6. Server logs don't show errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do I know if notifications were sent?</strong></summary>

Check the server terminal logs:
```
Email alerts sent: 2 successful, 0 failed
SMS alerts sent: 2 successful, 0 failed
```

Or run the diagnostic tool with test mode:
```bash
node debug-notifications.js
# Answer "yes" when asked to send test notifications
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Can I use my own SMTP server instead of Gmail?</strong></summary>

Yes! Edit `server/utils/sendEmail.js`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.yourdomain.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```
</details>

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If nothing works:

1. **Check server is actually running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. **Check MongoDB is connected:**
   - Server logs should show "MongoDB Connected Successfully"

3. **Check .env file exists and is in the right place:**
   ```bash
   ls -la server/.env
   ```

4. **Restart everything:**
   ```bash
   # Stop all terminals (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Check for typos in .env:**
   - No quotes around values
   - No spaces around = sign
   - Correct variable names (case-sensitive)

6. **Run diagnostic with verbose output:**
   ```bash
   node debug-notifications.js 2>&1 | tee debug-output.txt
   ```
   This saves all output to a file you can review.
