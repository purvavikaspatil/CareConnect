# üé§ Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Setup Guide

## Why Google Cloud TTS?

Your voice assistant now uses **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** for incredibly natural, human-like voice that will comfort elderly users instead of making them feel more isolated.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **FREE** for 4 million characters/month (you'll use ~375K/month)
- ‚úÖ **Human-like quality** - Neural2 voices sound like real people
- ‚úÖ **Emotional warmth** - Voices are caring and comforting
- ‚úÖ **Auto-fallback** - If not configured, uses browser TTS automatically

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Google Cloud API Key

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Create/Select Project:**
   - Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
   - Name it: `Elderly Assistant`
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable Text-to-Speech API:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/texttospeech.googleapis.com
   - Click "ENABLE" button
   - Wait ~30 seconds for activation

4. **Create API Key:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
   - Copy the API key (looks like: `AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

1. **Create `.env` file** in `elderly-assistant` folder:

```bash
# In elderly-assistant directory
touch .env
```

2. **Add this line to `.env`:**

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace `AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual API key!

3. **Restart the dev server:**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test It!

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/voice
2. Look for **green indicator**: "Premium Voice (Google Cloud TTS)"
3. Say "I'm feeling lonely"
4. Listen to the **dramatically improved** voice!

## ‚úÖ Verification

### **How to know it's working:**

1. **Visual Indicator:**
   - ‚úÖ Green dot + "Premium Voice (Google Cloud TTS)" = Working!
   - üîµ Blue dot + "Browser Voice" = Not configured yet

2. **Voice Quality:**
   - Google TTS: Sounds natural, warm, human-like
   - Browser TTS: Sounds robotic, mechanical

3. **Console Log:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - You'll see: `üé§ Google TTS playback complete`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still showing "Browser Voice"

**Solution 1: Check .env file location**
- File must be in: `elderly-assistant/.env` (NOT in root folder)
- File must be named exactly: `.env` (with the dot)

**Solution 2: Check API key format**
```env
# ‚úÖ Correct:
VITE_GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDZJT7xQ...

# ‚ùå Wrong (has quotes):
VITE_GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY="AIzaSyDZJT7xQ..."

# ‚ùå Wrong (typo in VITE_):
GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDZJT7xQ...
```

**Solution 3: Restart dev server**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Start again:
npm run dev
```

**Solution 4: Check API is enabled**
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
- Make sure "Cloud Text-to-Speech API" is enabled

### Problem: "API key not valid" error

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your API key
3. Click "Edit"
4. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
5. Check only: "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"
6. Save

### Problem: Exceeded quota

**This is extremely unlikely** (4M chars = ~80,000 phrases), but if it happens:
- App automatically falls back to browser TTS
- Or upgrade to paid tier: $4 per 1M additional characters

---

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### Free Tier (Permanent):
- **4,000,000 characters/month** = FREE
- Enough for: ~80,000 voice responses
- Your estimated usage: ~375,000 chars/month

### Paid Tier (If you exceed free):
- **$4 per 1 million characters**
- Standard voices: $4/million
- Neural2 voices: $16/million (we use these)

### Realistic Cost Estimate:

| Users | Daily Use | Monthly Chars | Cost |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------|
| 1 | 50 interactions | 375K | **$0** (FREE) |
| 10 | 50 interactions | 3.75M | **$0** (FREE) |
| 20 | 50 interactions | 7.5M | $0.56/mo |
| 50 | 50 interactions | 18.75M | $2.40/mo |

**Bottom line:** FREE for this use case! üéâ

## üé≠ Voice Configurations

The system uses different voices for different emotions:

| Emotion | Voice | Characteristics |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sad/Lonely** | Neural2-C | Very warm, soothing, slow |
| **Empathetic** | Neural2-C | Gentle, caring, comforting |
| **Happy** | Neural2-F | Bright, pleasant, warm |
| **Urgent** | Neural2-G | Clear, calm, authoritative |
| **Neutral** | Neural2-C | Friendly, warm, helpful |

All voices are **female** as research shows they're perceived as more caring and comforting for healthcare applications.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Key Security:

1. **Never commit `.env` to Git:**
   - Already in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
   - Always use environment variables

2. **Restrict API key:**
   - Only allow "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"
   - Restrict to your domain in production

3. **For Production:**
   - Use backend proxy (don't expose API key to browser)
   - Or use Firebase Functions to call TTS
   - Or use IAM roles instead of API keys

### Current Setup (Dev):
- ‚úÖ API key in `.env` (not committed)
- ‚úÖ Limited to TTS API only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API key visible in browser (OK for development/demo)
- üîß For production, use backend proxy

---

## üìä Comparison

### Before (Browser TTS):
- Voice: Robotic, mechanical
- Emotion: Flat, uncaring
- User feeling: "It sounds like a robot"
- Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)

### After (Google Cloud TTS):
- Voice: Natural, human-like
- Emotion: Warm, caring, empathetic
- User feeling: "It sounds like a real person who cares"
- Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5)

## üéØ Test Phrases

Try these to hear the difference:

### Sad Emotion:
```
"I'm feeling so lonely today"
```
**Expected:** Very slow, gentle, comforting voice

### Happy Emotion:
```
"I'm feeling wonderful today!"
```
**Expected:** Brighter, pleasant, warm voice

### Emergency:
```
"Help me!"
```
**Expected:** Clear, calm, reassuring but urgent

---

## üîÑ Migration Path

### Phase 1: Development (Now)
- ‚úÖ API key in `.env`
- ‚úÖ Good for testing
- ‚úÖ FREE tier

### Phase 2: Production (Future)
Option A: **Backend Proxy** (Recommended)
- API key on server
- Frontend calls backend
- Backend calls Google TTS
- More secure

Option B: **Firebase Functions**
- Serverless function
- Call TTS from function
- No server management

Option C: **Service Account**
- Use IAM instead of API key
- More secure
- Better for scale

## üÜò Still Need Help?

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- ‚úÖ `üì¢ Using browser TTS (Google Cloud TTS not configured)` = API key not found
- ‚úÖ `üé§ Google TTS playback complete` = Working!
- ‚ùå `TTS API error: 400` = API key invalid
- ‚ùå `TTS API error: 403` = API not enabled

### Option 2: Test Manually
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Paste this:
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY)
// Should show your API key, not 'undefined'
```

### Option 3: Verify .env Location
```bash
# In elderly-assistant directory
ls -la .env
# Should show: .env file exists
```
