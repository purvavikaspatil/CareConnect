## 🎯 How It Works

### **User Flow:**

```
1. User speaks/types: "I'm feeling lonely today"
                ↓
2. Frontend detects emotion: "sad"
                ↓
3. Sends to backend with context
                ↓
4. Backend tries:
   - Hugging Face AI → Gets empathetic response
   - Or Ollama (if installed)
   - Or rule-based fallback
                ↓
5. AI reply: "I'm here with you, Mary..."
                ↓
6. Frontend speaks with modulation:
   - Pitch: 0.8 (gentle)
   - Rate: 0.85 (slow, comforting)
                ↓
7. User hears caring, empathetic voice
```

### **Conversation Context:**

```javascript
AI remembers last 5 exchanges:
[
  { role: "user", content: "I'm lonely" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "I'm here with you..." },
  { role: "user", content: "Thank you" },
  // ... etc
]

This helps AI:
- Remember what was discussed
- Provide continuity
- Give better responses
```
