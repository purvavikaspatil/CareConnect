  - `SpeechRecognition` / `webkitSpeechRecognition`
  - `SpeechSynthesis` / `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`
- **React Router**: For navigation

### Key Implementation Details

#### Speech Recognition Setup
```javascript
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition()
recognition.continuous = false
recognition.interimResults = true
recognition.lang = 'en-US'
```

#### Text-to-Speech
```javascript
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text)
utterance.rate = 0.9  // Slightly slower for clarity
utterance.pitch = 1
utterance.volume = 1
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
```

#### Command Processing
Commands are processed using case-insensitive string matching:
```javascript
const lowerCommand = command.toLowerCase().trim()
if (lowerCommand.includes('show reminder')) {
  navigate('/reminders')
  speak('Opening your reminders now')
}
```
