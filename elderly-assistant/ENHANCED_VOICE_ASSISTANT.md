- **Volume Control**: Subtle volume adjustments for different situations

### 4. **Natural Conversation**
- **Flexible Phrases**: Understands natural language, not just rigid commands
- **Follow-up Responses**: Can say "yes" or "okay" to continue previous topics

   v.name.includes('Enhanced'))
)
```

## 🧠 Context Retention System

### **State Management**

The assistant maintains several context variables:

```javascript
{
  userName: "John",              // User's name
  lastTopic: "emotional_support", // Last conversation topic
  lastEmotion: "sad",            // Last detected emotion
  conversationHistory: [         // Full conversation log
    {
      user: "I'm feeling lonely",
      emotion: "sad",
      timestamp: "2025-10-29T04:10:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Topic Categories**

- `emotional_support` - User shared feelings
- `reminders` - Discussed medications/appointments
- `contacts` - Talked about family/friends
- `health_concern` - Mentioned illness/pain
- `emergency` - Requested help
- `greeting` - Said hello
- `positive_mood` - Expressed happiness
- `boredom` - Mentioned boredom

### **Follow-Up Intelligence**

When user says "yes", "okay", "sure" after a suggestion, the assistant remembers the context:

```javascript
// Example flow:
Assistant: "Would you like to check your reminders?"
User: "Yes"  // System knows to navigate to reminders
```

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### **Speech Recognition Setup**

```javascript
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition()
recognition.continuous = false      // One utterance at a time
recognition.interimResults = true   // Show partial results
recognition.lang = 'en-US'          // English language
```

### **Text-to-Speech with Emotion**

```javascript
const speak = (text, emotion = 'neutral') => {
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text)
  
  // Select best voice
  utterance.voice = selectedVoice
  
  // Modulate based on emotion
  switch (emotion) {
    case 'sad':
      utterance.pitch = 0.9
      utterance.rate = 0.85
      break
    case 'happy':
      utterance.pitch = 1.1
      utterance.rate = 1.0
      break
    // ... more emotions
  }
  
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
}
```

### **Emotion Detection**

```javascript
const detectEmotion = (text) => {
  const lowerText = text.toLowerCase()
  
  // Regex matching for emotion keywords
  if (lowerText.match(/\b(sad|lonely|alone|depressed)\b/)) {
    return 'sad'
  }
  if (lowerText.match(/\b(happy|great|wonderful|excited)\b/)) {
